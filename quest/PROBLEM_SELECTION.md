# Problem Specialization

## Problem Addressed

Modern LLM agents frequently fail when external tools return incomplete or unreliable data.

These failures often go unnoticed and lead to hallucinated or unsafe outputs.

---

## Why This Problem Was Chosen

In real-world production environments, reliability failures are more critical than intelligence limitations.

Incorrect confidence causes:
- automation failures
- incorrect decision execution
- loss of user trust

---

## Priority Definition

The primary priority was:

> Build an agent that learns from behavioral failure instead of optimizing first-attempt accuracy.

This project focuses on:
- failure handling
- execution evaluation
- persistent behavioral learning

---

## Expected Impact

The system demonstrates how autonomous agents can:
- recognize mistakes
- adapt safely
- improve reliability over time

This mirrors real enterprise AI deployment requirements.
